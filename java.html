    <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is known for its platform independence, meaning Java code can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), following the principle "write once, run anywhere." Java is widely used for building enterprise-level applications, mobile apps (especially Android), web-based applications, and software tools. It emphasizes security, robustness, and simplicity, and features automatic memory management through garbage collection. With a rich set of libraries and strong community support, Java remains one of the most popular and versatile programming languages in the world. </p>
