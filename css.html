    <p>The full form of CSS is Cascading Style Sheets. 
        It is a style sheet language used to add styles to HTML documents displayed in browsers. CSS enhances the user experience by making web pages more attractive and user-friendly. Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996</p>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
