    <p>Spring is a powerful, lightweight, and widely-used framework for building enterprise-level applications in Java. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model that supports modern software development practices such as dependency injection (DI), aspect-oriented programming (AOP), and modular architecture. The core features of Spring make it easy to manage application components and promote loose coupling for better code maintainability. Spring also includes extensions for building web applications (Spring MVC), accessing databases (Spring Data), securing apps (Spring Security), and creating microservices (Spring Boot). Its flexibility, scalability, and wide ecosystem make it a popular choice for Java developers building robust and efficient applications.
