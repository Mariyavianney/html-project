    <p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for storing and managing structured data. Developed by Oracle Corporation, MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing databases. It is known for its reliability, speed, and ease of use, making it a popular choice for web applications, especially those built with PHP, such as WordPress and other content management systems. MySQL supports features like transactions, replication, and multi-user access, and it can handle large databases efficiently. Its compatibility with various platforms and integration with many programming languages makes it a key component in many modern software stacks, including the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl).
