    <p>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. Originally developed by Netscape in the mid-1990s, JavaScript has evolved into a powerful language that runs in web browsers and enables features like form validation, animations, and real-time updates without reloading the page. It is a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript also supports object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming styles. With the rise of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, and the use of Node.js for server-side development, JavaScript has become essential for both front-end and back-end web development.
