    <p>Django is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, Django handles much of the hassle of web development, allowing developers to focus on writing their app without needing to reinvent common solutions like authentication, database management, or URL routing. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture and emphasizes reusability, scalability, and security. Django comes with a powerful admin interface, built-in ORM, and a wide range of libraries, making it a popular choice for developing robust, database-driven websites quickly and efficiently.
