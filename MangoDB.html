    <p>MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database designed for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents (called BSON), allowing for dynamic schemas and faster development. This document-oriented approach makes it ideal for modern applications that require scalability, real-time analytics, and high performance. MongoDB is known for its ease of use, horizontal scaling through sharding, and strong querying capabilities. It is commonly used in big data, content management, and mobile applications, and is a key part of the MEAN and MERN technology stacks for full-stack JavaScript development.
