    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. Built on Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js enables fast and scalable network applications by using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This makes it ideal for building real-time applications like chat apps, streaming services, and APIs. With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side programming, promoting a unified development environment. It also has a rich ecosystem of libraries available through npm (Node Package Manager), making it a powerful choice for modern web development.
